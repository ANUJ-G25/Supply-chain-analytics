# Supply-chain-analytics
In this project, I analyzed a substantial supply chain dataset of 180k rows to uncover key operational issues. Using Python, I performed extensive data cleaning, removing columns with over 80% missing values and selecting the most relevant variables based on correlation. My analysis focused on understanding the impact of delivery status on supply chain performance, revealing regions with high rates of late deliveries and preferred shipping modes. Additionally, I identified the highest contributors to fraud and pending orders, providing actionable insights to improve customer satisfaction and revenue. This project demonstrated my ability to handle large datasets, perform detailed data analysis, and generate valuable business insights to optimize supply chain operations.
